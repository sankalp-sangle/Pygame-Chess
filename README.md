# Pygame Chess

Here's a very nice way in which I spent my weekend :)
Coded something simple and purely for recreation. I had missed coding for the sake of enjoyment for a very very long time!

Also check out The Queen's Gambit. Still can't get over that show.

To play it:

```bash
$ pip3 install pygame
$ cd src
$ python3 game.py
```
